* Click the "Code" ![img](src/assets/code.png) and click the 'Download zip' option ![img](src/assets/zip.png).
* Unzip the file, navigate to the `Models` directory to check code or to the `ModelTests` directory to see tests.
#### From the terminal: 
* Clone my repository from GitHub using `git clone https://github.com/DanielAdeyemi/Epicodus_2_22_LeapYear.git` in your terminal or GitBash
* Navigate to the downloaded folder using ***cd*** command
* Execute **code .** command in your terminal and it will open all source code in your code editor.    
*Note: To run this project locally you will need to have .NET Core. You can check if you have .NET Core by running dotnet --version in the command line. If you do not have .NET Core please find more information and download [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet)*
